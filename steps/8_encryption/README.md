# Step 8: Encryption Implementation

This step implements message encryption options in the js-waku React application. It adds support for both asymmetric (ECIES) and symmetric encryption.

## What's New in This Step

1. **Encryption Manager**: A new `EncryptionManager` class that handles encryption operations.
2. **Encryption Types**: Support for both ECIES (asymmetric) and symmetric encryption.
3. **Key Management**: Functions for generating, importing, and exporting encryption keys.
4. **UI Components**: Enhanced UI for toggling encryption and managing keys.
5. **Encrypted Messages**: Messages now display their encryption status.

## Implementation Details

### Encryption Manager

The `EncryptionManager` class provides:
- Functions for generating ECIES and symmetric keys
- Methods for creating encoders and decoders with encryption
- Utilities for importing and exporting keys as hex strings

### Context Updates

The Waku context has been extended with:
- Encryption state (enabled/disabled)
- Current encryption type
- Functions for toggling encryption and changing encryption type
- Key management functions

### UI Enhancements

- The `EncryptionToggle` component now allows users to:
  - Toggle encryption on/off
  - Select encryption type (ECIES or symmetric)
  - Generate new keys
  - Import/export keys

- The `MessageForm` component shows the current encryption status
- The `MessageList` component displays encryption information for messages

## How to Use

1. **Toggle Encryption**: Use the toggle switch to enable/disable encryption.
2. **Select Encryption Type**: Choose between ECIES (asymmetric) and symmetric encryption.
3. **Generate Keys**: Click "Generate Keys" to create new encryption keys.
4. **Share Keys**: 
   - For ECIES: Share your public key with others
   - For symmetric: Share the symmetric key with others
5. **Import Keys**:
   - For ECIES: Import others' public keys
   - For symmetric: Import the shared symmetric key

## Technical Notes

- ECIES encryption uses public/private key pairs
- Symmetric encryption uses a shared key
- Keys are exported as hex strings for easy sharing
- The encryption type is included in message metadata

## Next Steps

The next step will implement debugging utilities to help troubleshoot issues with the Waku node and message handling.
