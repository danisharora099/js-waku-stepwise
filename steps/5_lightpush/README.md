# Waku React Example - Step 5: Lightpush Implementation

This step implements the ability to send messages using Waku's Lightpush protocol. We've updated the UI to allow users to compose and send messages.

## What's New in This Step

1. **Message Sending Functionality**:
   - Implemented a `MessageManager` class in `messaging.ts` for handling all message-related operations
   - Created a custom `useSendMessage` hook in `hooks.ts` for sending messages
   - Updated the MessageForm component to use the new hook

2. **Class-Based Architecture**:
   - Adopted a class-based approach for better organization and encapsulation
   - Created singleton instances for managers (similar to the `WakuNodeManager`)
   - Improved code structure and maintainability

3. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Added a sender name input field
   - Implemented loading and error states
   - Added validation for message and sender inputs
   - Disabled the send button when the node is not connected or when sending is in progress

## How to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:5173

## Key Files Changed

- `src/lib/waku/messaging.ts` - Created `MessageManager` class for message operations
- `src/lib/waku/hooks.ts` - Created `useSendMessage` hook using the `MessageManager`
- `src/components/MessageForm.tsx` - Updated to use the new hook and added UI enhancements

## Next Steps

In the next step, we'll implement the ability to receive messages using Waku's Filter protocol.
