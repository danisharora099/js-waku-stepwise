# Waku React Example - Step 7: Store Implementation

This step implements the ability to retrieve historical messages using Waku's Store protocol. We've updated the UI to display both real-time and historical messages.

## What's New in This Step

1. **Historical Message Retrieval**:
   - Enhanced the `MessageManager` class with methods for querying historical messages
   - Created a custom `useHistoricalMessages` hook for managing historical messages
   - Updated the MessageList component to display both real-time and historical messages

2. **Message Management**:
   - Implemented message deduplication to avoid showing duplicate messages
   - Added sorting to display messages in chronological order
   - Created controls for toggling between showing and hiding historical messages

3. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Added a "Load History" button to retrieve historical messages
   - Implemented visual indicators for historical messages
   - Added loading states for historical message retrieval
   - Enhanced the message list with better filtering and sorting

## How to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
