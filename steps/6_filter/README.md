# Waku React Example - Step 6: Filter Implementation

This step implements the ability to receive messages using Waku's Filter protocol. We've updated the UI to display received messages.

## What's New in This Step

1. **Message Receiving Functionality**:
   - Enhanced the `MessageManager` class with methods for subscribing to and receiving messages
   - Created a custom `useMessages` hook for managing received messages
   - Updated the MessageList component to display received messages

2. **Subscription Management**:
   - Implemented subscription tracking and cleanup
   - Added proper error handling for subscriptions
   - Created utility functions for unsubscribing from messages

3. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Added real-time message display
   - Implemented message timestamps with relative time formatting
   - Added loading and error states for message subscriptions
   - Added a clear button to reset the message list

## How to Run

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```
